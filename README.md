# Iris Flower Classification using Neural Network  

## Description  
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Neural Network to classify the Iris flower dataset into three species:  

- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

The model is built and trained using the popular **Iris dataset**, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:  

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

The goal is to classify the species based on these features.  

## Features  
- Multi-class classification using neural networks.  
- Implements data preprocessing and feature scaling.  
- Train/test split for performance evaluation.  
- Achieves high accuracy with a simple neural network architecture.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Pytorch  
  - Matplotlib (for visualizations)
